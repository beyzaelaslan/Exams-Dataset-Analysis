# Exams-Dataset-Analysis

#### In the project, various libraries were utilized for data analysis and visualization without specifying method names. Initially, the dataset was read using the pandas library, and general information was obtained using relevant functions. Subsequently, statistical summaries for numeric columns were generated, and matplotlib.pyplot library was employed for visual representation.

#### Mod values, mean, and median values were visualized through histograms. Additionally, the mode of the gender column was represented using a pie chart. Barplot from the seaborn library was employed to rank parental education levels based on counts. Lastly, the counts of students who passed or failed the preparation course were visualized, and real counts were displayed on each bar for enhanced clarity.
